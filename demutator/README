The demutator is a little tool that extracts all the permutations from a superpermutation and formats
them in an output file (in this case, out.txt) so that they line up with the superpermutations given
in the data file (in this case, data.txt). The first line of the data file may only contain the
"radix," or the "largest number whose permutations have been superpermutated"
ex: radix "2" -> superpermutation "121"

This code is by no means devoid of all errors, and you can probably find a way to completely break it,
but it should be completely fine given the job it was designed for.

I've included both the data and output files so you can get a feel for what this does.

Its purpose is to aid in manually determining patterns with the superpermutations. I found that by
lining up the permutations like this, some things start to stand out about their construction.
